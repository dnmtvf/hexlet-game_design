### It’s a simple boilerplate for writing and debuging ES6 JS code.
#### It helps me to pass [Hexlet.io](https://hexlet.io) courses and it trains me to use TDD approach.
#### It uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) watch option, means you only need to write code and any changes passes to console output.

#### How to use:
1. git clone https://github.com/dnmtvf/hexlet-courses-boilerplate.git
2. cd hexlet-courses-boilerplate
3. yarn install (if you are not using yarn - npm install)
4. Create file someName.test.js and someName.js in «src» folder
5. npm run tdd -f someName.test.js (starts Jest in watch mode)
6. Use TDD mantra — red: write a failing test and run it, green: make the test pass, and refactor: look at the code and see if you can make it any better
